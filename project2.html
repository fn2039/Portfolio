					The main theme/idea behind the comic was to talk about how some nations are handling covid 19 situation and the effects of covid 19 on some nations. One of the key ideas was to state both former mentioned goals in a lighthearted way. The intention is not at all to joke about the situation , but for sarcastically make people realize their wrong actions at wrong times and giving them an insight on how badly many places have been affected. The whole team had their minds set on making the project a lighthearted experience for viewers as well as an opportunity to assess the current pandemic situation where many nations are still at risk of second wave.

					The main idea was collectively decided within the group. For images, after collecting some inspiration from web and discussion within group, Shamma and I made basic first sketches on paper and divided the work amongst ourselves. To ensure lighthearted experience, we decided on making our panels colorful and use light colors and avoid dark hues as much as we can. For the text script too, the written content is kept to minimum and font styles are also kept simple. The text color is also kept light and smooth simple animations are added in the comic to keep the whole experience lively and light.

					This assignment is my first experience with comics in general (reading for ideas, creating new ones). I was responsible for drawing images through illustrator. The initial sketches were made on paper and then corresponding part of image were looked up on web and then traced on illustrator using pen tool. In the beginning much of the time was spent on playing with different tools and features of illustrator. This included looking up on google for how to do help with some tools. The first panel took quite a while but after it was a very pleasant experience working with illustrator (for I got to practice more of my favorite free time activity). The process also making changes accordingly after rendering the code on browser and removing some major imperfections. Due to time constraint, some of minor imperfections in drawings were not addressed. Despite a challenging journey, this project has been a great learning experience.
