					Due to pandemic, many people struggled with their friendships. Considering this, the team decided on having an artificial friend that would provide user a ‘natural’ experience. The project is about branding a newly designed, AI integrated device that is going to be users’ friend. The device has two models and can be further customized in terms of color and language. This idea is being conveyed through the product’s advertising video, where the customized products are being used by three different users in their daily life. The idea for the website was to create it with an inviting and friendly theme. The overall experience is intended to be calming and light-hearted.

					The video is designed as the official branding video for the product launch, in which the CEO of the company introduces the product followed by three customers using the demo product in their lives. To gain attention of the audience, the user experiences in the video were made highly personalized by each person writing their own script and designing the experience for their part. I wrote my script based on my personal experience and emotions involving the incident. Other than that, I was involved in designing the website along with Rashid. We decided on implementing the different colors (of product) in the fonts and design elements on the website. The interactivity and design elements were added in just the right amount to make the site look professional and at the same time making it friendly and calm unlike many tech gadgets-based websites.

					Rollercoaster. This one word sums up my experience. It was scary to hop on and take co-responsibility of website as other simply decided otherwise. This was my second experience with web development , after the very basic 30 MFF website. Initially, it was very daunting, but then I divided the website design into smaller parts and worked on it. All these elements were constantly being enhanced. The ride was, for sure, very bumpy as there were frequent (unhelpful) panic attacks amongst other members on code breaks, which made it more difficult to resolve issues. This project made me realize the great impact of team on the working experience. However, this was a very rewarding experience as I learned a lot during designing this website, thanks to w3schools and stackoverflow. I also enjoyed putting my artsy skills in use when designing the logo, main loader background and dividers. The final design of the website makes me feel accomplished – to tone it down a bit, I would say I feel satisfied with result. I now feel confident enough to code for my portfolio.
