					Our sound project is focused on a mysterious kidnapping and murder. This genre was decided after my partner and I had goals to create a sound piece that triggers audiences’ wild imagination through abstraction. Without explicit mention of place, characters and plot, the concept behind this particular storyline and implementation is to grab audience attention and interest in the project till the end. Another reason for leaving a lot to imagination with subtle hints was to create a highly individualized experience which could lead to conversation amongst the group of individuals figuring out the correct (or intended) implementation. Another goal of this project was to be able to gauge interest of large audiences (specifically suspense, horror, mystery, murder, and triller lovers) and most importantly visually impaired audience.
				</p>
				<p class="description" align="left">
					The storyline was implemented in three parts: where (location), who (characters) and why (cliffhanger). To achieve our goal of triggering audiences’ imagination through imagination, the background sounds for location are kept to minimum and suspense/horror background sounds are added to intensify the effects. A few hints about the kidnapper’s appearance and personality are given to audience through the conversation between kidnapper and child throughout the storyline. The story is ended on a cliff hanger without the reason of kidnapping or murder (intentional or unintentional) being revealed. To attract the visually impaired audience, the sound piece is created to be able to provide standalone experience. Visuals have been incorporated to the website as an additional experience, where visually impaired would not lose any real/ intended experience.

					Initially, we had two project ideas: soundscape to show difference between same public locations of two or more countries and murder mystery. The first idea was scrapped after we realize that a few fellow students were working on similar concept. I was responsible for script (which involved back and forth changes until the last minute), finding all the possible sounds and visuals from web and designing different visuals (e.g posters, logos etc) for the website. In short, I carried out the creative tasks while my partner worked on technical implementation. For the creative process, I can conclude that our main goals were successfully accomplished. However, considering the time constraint we decided on simple technical implementation (rather than our initial plans of adding a lot of interactivity on webpage). This project had been very overwhelming for me as we juggled with work in the time limit and constantly evolving script and creative content. However, in the end, we managed to achieve our realistically expected project.
