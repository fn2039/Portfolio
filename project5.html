					As an optional project for Introduction to Computer Science, this website has been designed, for potential students and first-years not on campus yet, to get to know about the NYUAD and it's Computer Science program from a student's perspective. In this blog-like website, I mention my experience on campus during the pandemic. It also has an exciting feature for freshmen to buy merchandise. This had been included to implement the use of Python programs in the web development. The program takes input from data, assess it and display a webpage with the processed information.

				<p class="description" align="left">
					Connection to NYUAD VPN is required to access the website as this website is uploaded on the NYUAD server. Use the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client with your NYUID credientials. Look up intranet if more help is required in installing Cisco or setting up the VPN. The website has been developed using a bootstrap template. The design asthetics of the page are dveloped keeping in mind the NYU color codes. For the same purpose, the text and other background colors have been kept a light on the eyes and chosen from pastel shades of purple.

					This assignment is my first experience working with Python programs on the web. Despite being troublesome experience with uploading on the server and making it function properly, it was a great learning opporutnity. During editing the code template, the font style and color scheme was updated to achieve my goal of making a light, calming webpage with NYU theme. Much of the experience was trial and error. Alot of time was spend on internet figuring out how to include certain elements in my project and then customizing the styling as per requirement. I would like to conclude this by stating that despite a rocky start, this project has been a great learning experience.
